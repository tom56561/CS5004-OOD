/**
 * Animated movie is a specific type of movie (it implements the Movie interface).
 * You need to make a class diagram. 
 * The class diagram should include the methods the interface requires,
 * as well as any class variables that you think the class would require
 * given the methods and the descriptions in the interface.
 * 
 * Once you have your class diagram, you need to give the concrete implementations
 * for getPublicationYear, jumpToTime, and resetProgress
 * 
 * You can assume that getTitle and saveProgress are implemented correctly.
 * You can also assume that there is a constructor that properly initializes
 * all of the class variables that you include in your class diagram. 
 * 
 * If you think you need any other methods to properly implement your 3 methods, 
 * you may add them as private methods, and then update your class diagram to 
 * include them.
 * 
 * You do not need to make your code run or test your code. Instead you should try to give
 * the best implementation you can based off of the documentation. If you have any
 * assumptions you wish to make, you should specify them in comments. 
 * If you don't understand how something should work, decide how you think it should work and
 * make sure you write documentation specifying how you think it should work.
 * 
 * Make sure to include the class diagram, that is as important as the code you write here.
